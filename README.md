## Data cleansing
...is the process of detecting and correcting (or removing) corrupt or inaccurate records from a record set, table, or database and refers to identifying incomplete, incorrect, inaccurate or irrelevant parts of the data and then replacing, modifying, or deleting the dirty or coarse data. Data cleansing may be performed interactively with data wrangling tools, or as batch processing through scripting.

## Data wrangling
...the process of manually converting or mapping data from one "raw" form into another format that allows for more convenient consumption of the data with the help of semi-automated tools. This may include further munging, data visualization, data aggregation, training a statistical model, as well as many other potential uses. Data munging as a process typically follows a set of general steps which begin with extracting the data in a raw form from the data source, "munging" the raw data using algorithms (e.g. sorting) or parsing the data into predefined data structures, and finally depositing the resulting content into a data sink for storage and future use. 

## Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis
At a high level, EDA is the practice of using visual and quantitative methods to understand and summarize a dataset without making any assumptions about its contents. It is a crucial step to take before diving into machine learning or statistical modeling because it provides the context needed to develop an appropriate model for the problem at hand and to correctly interpret its results.

## Step 3: Dealing with Missing Values

## Step 4: Dealing with Outliers
This is not a tutorial on drafting a strategy to deal with outliers in your data when modeling; there are times when including outliers in modeling is appropriate, and there are times when they are not (regardless of what anyone tries to tell you). This is situation-dependent, and no one can make sweeping assertions as to whether your situation belongs in column A or column B. 

## Step 5: Dealing with Imbalanced Data


## Step 6: Data Transformations
In statistics, data transformation is the application of a deterministic mathematical function to each point in a data set â€” that is, each data point zi is replaced with the transformed value yi = f(zi), where f is a function. Transforms are usually applied so that the data appear to more closely meet the assumptions of a statistical inference procedure that is to be applied, or to improve the interpretability or appearance of graphs.
